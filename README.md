# Quiver

> Your quiver of arrows to declaratively render arrows in HTML. Connect an arrow to HTML elements via CSS selectors and this library will automatically track the movement and resizing of those elements and update the arrow accordingly. Your quiver comes with a growing number of types of arrows and the tools to easily create your own!
